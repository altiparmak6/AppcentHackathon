# AppcentHackathon

Coded for sustainable city for 40 hours. Placed 3rd

Correct use of limited resources is important for a sustainable city and conscious individuals are needed to ensure this.
In this project, I made an application that can raise awareness about the use of water resources for primary school students.
Points are earned through various tasks in the 'Challenge' section of the app.
For example, keeping the shower time short, reviewing habits, giving information to a friend...
In the 'Learn and Earn' section, an information text is displayed and a question is asked about it, and correct answers are rewarded with points.
In this way, I hoped that the level of awareness of the person about the subject would be increased with the daily updated learn and earn activities.
